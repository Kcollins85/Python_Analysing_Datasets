# Python - Analysing Datasets

# PyBank Instructions
Create a Python script to analyse the financial records of a company using a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Create a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following values:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- Your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
